Create a class Library that implements the class definition provided below.

The Library class comprises the following attributes: Data members (private)

Member Type	    Member Name	    Description
string	        _name	        The name of the Library
const int	    _MAX_BOOKS	    The maximum number of books the library can hold; will be 10 for this question
int[]	        _page_counts	Array containing the page counts of books in the library. The size of this array is _MAX_BOOKS
int	            _current_books	The current number of books in the Library.

NOTE _current_books serves as the insertion index for the _page_counts array.

Member Functions (public)

Function	                Description
Default constructor	        Creates a new instance of Library by setting _name to an empty string, _current_books to 0, and each entry in _page_counts to 0.
Library(string)	            Creates a new instance of Library with _name as the string parameter. The _current_books is set to 0, and each entry in the _page_counts array is set to 0.
Library(string, int[], int)	Creates a new instance of Library with _name as the string parameter, _current_books as the integer parameter, and fills the _page_counts array. See Function Specification table below for more details.
string getName()	        Returns the _name of the Library.
int getCurrentBooks()	    Returns the _current_books of the Library.
void setName(string)	    Sets the _name to the value of the provided string parameter.
int getPageCount(int)	    Returns the page count at a specified index in _page_counts, or -1 if the index is out of bounds.
bool addPageCount(int)	    Returns true if the new page count can be added to the _page_counts array. If _current_books is already equal to _MAX_BOOKS, returns false. See Function Specification table below for more details.



Function Specifications:

Function:	Library(string, int[], int)
Library(string name, int page_counts[], int arr_size)
Purpose:	This parameterized constructor creates a new instance of the Library class. 
- Sets _name to name. 
- Sets _current_books to arr_size if arr_size doesnâ€™t exceed _MAX_BOOKS; otherwise, _current_books is set to _MAX_BOOKS. 
- Copies elements from page_counts[] into the _page_counts[] array, up to the size indicated by _current_books.
Parameters:	string name - The name of the Library. 
int page_counts[] - Array containing page counts of books in the library. 
int arr_size - The size of the page_counts[] array.
 
Return Value:	N/A
Error Handling:	If arr_size exceeds _MAX_BOOKS, only the first _MAX_BOOKSelements are stored in the _page_counts[] array. Do NOT print any other statements to handle this scenario.
